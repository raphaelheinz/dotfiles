# üè† Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles managed with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

These dotfiles help me keep a consistent development environment across machines. Everything is reproducible, version-controlled, and portable.

Tracked files include configs for the shell, editor, terminal, git, and custom scripts.
